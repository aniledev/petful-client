        Here at FIFO we believe that every pet deserves a chance at there
        furever home. This vision inspired us to create one of the first and
        premier FIFO pet adoption services. This means that the first cat or dog
        to come to shelter must be adopted first. If you wish to join the
        waiting list and take one of our adorable pets home soon, click the link
